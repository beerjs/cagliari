# BeerJS Cagliari, IT

We want CagliariJS to be a place where JavaScript professionals and enthusiasts meet, chat, exchange ideas and experiences.

If you:

* Work with JavaScript or related technologies
* Want to get in touch with developers like you
* Happen to be in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy every once in a while

Then we think you should join us. Come have a beer and a chat!
